# lunar-core

The Infineon XMC microcontrollers inside Lunar Energy's products are based on Arm's Cortex-M series of 32-bit embedded processors. Since we chose Cortex-M for our embedded processors, selecting Arm's Keil tools made the most sense for our embedded software development.

The smart inverter has an XMC4800 micro inside. Each battery block has an XMC4400 micro inside. Each photovoltaic optimizer each has an XMC1400 micro inside. Both the XMC4800 and XMC4400 are based on the Cortex-M4 processor core. The XMC1400 is based on the Cortex-M0 processor core.

## Build status

Frank Vasquez has provisioned a TeamCity server and build agent on his Windows 10 machine at home. This server is scheduled to build all three XMC micro projects on a daily basis at 3 PM GMT time. The daily build only runs if pending changes have been pushed to any branch of this Git repo since the last scheduled build.

Current build status is reported as a :heavy_check_mark: or :x: next to the latest commit displayed at the top of this page. Clicking on **Details** for the most recent build returns a 404 because the TeamCity server is not on the internet. Logs for any failed builds can be found found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FT794MykWpJz253lTfdD_sGVFQVrSaU7) on Google Drive.

## Prerequisites

If you can view this README then you already have access to this private Git repo under [Lunar Energy's GitHub organization](https://github.com/lunar-energy).

### Hardware

Developing firmware for Lunar Energy requires the following hardware.

- machine capable of running Windows 10
- USB port
- micro USB cable
- [Infineon XMC4400 Platform2Go](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc_plt2go_xmc4400/)
- [Infineon XMC4800 IoT Amazon FreeRTOS Connectivity kit WIFI](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/infineon-technologies/KITXMC48IOTAWSWIFITOBO1/9816150)
- [Infineon XMC1400 Boot Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc14_boot_001/)

Each of the XMC dev boards comes with a micro USB port for powering, flashing and debugging so a free USB port is needed on the Windows end to connect the two.

### Software

Developing firmware for Lunar Energy requires the following software.

- VirtualBox on Linux or Parallels on macOS
- Windows 10
- Git
- [J-Link drivers](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)
- [MicroBoot](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ESPlwmsz8aK--Jb_gk6VmOd1Eg2U3FX)
- [Keil MDK](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/)

Windows is needed to run the Keil MDK required for microcontroller software development. [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) can be installed using [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/git) or by downloading and running the latest installer from gitforwindows.org. Windows 10 comes with an SSH client built-in so there is no need to install one for authenticating to GitHub.

## Getting started

Here are the steps to provision a Windows environment for firmware development.

1. Download and install SEGGER's J-Link Software and Documentation Pack for Windows from https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/.

2. Download the MicroBoot utility and its associated DLLs from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ESPlwmsz8aK--Jb_gk6VmOd1Eg2U3FX) on Google Drive. Keep these files together inside the same folder after downloading.

3. Download and install the Keil MDK from https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/. The MDK-Lite edition is sufficient if you don't have an MDK-Essential license yet since the 32 KB code size restriction is not an issue.

4. Clone this repo from a PowerShell terminal:

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Frank> git clone git@github.com:lunar-energy/lunar-core.git
Cloning into 'lunar-core'...
The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.255.112)' can't be established.

```

Access to this Git repo is restricted to select Lunar Energy employees, so you must add your public SSH key (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to your account settings on GitHub before you can clone it.

## Directory structure

The C source and header files are in the `Src` directory. Code for each XMC dev board is located in its respective subdirectory under `Src/Boards`. Code shared across all XMC micros is located in the top-level `Src` directory and the `Infineon/XMC` directory under `Src/Devices`. Think of this common code as a HAL that wraps the underlying board-specific implementations.

Keil uVision project and options files (`.uvprojx` and `.uvoptx`) for each XMC dev board are located under `Toolchain`. uVision is the name of the IDE part of the Keil MDK.

Detailed documentation covering the contents of each firmware release can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_bH25hwK9uLD3OuWYe7Ob0dE_AA1WrSv) on Google Drive.

## Building

Keil uVision is a graphical IDE so a developer typically builds a project manually by clicking with their mouse.

To build code targeting the XMC4400 Platform2Go dev board for the first time:

1. Launch Keil uVision5
2. Select **Open Project...** from the **Project** menu
3. Locate the `XMC4400_Platform2Go` project file under this repo's `Toolchain` directory
4. Install the Infineon XMC4000 Device Family Pack when prompted
5. Click on the **Build** button on the toolbar to build the target files

Steps 2 through 4 can be skipped the next time around. Many menu options like **Build Target** have keyboard shortcuts associated with them to speed up the build and debug cycle.

The process for building the `XMC4800_AWS` and `XMC1400_Boot` project files is equivalent.

## Flashing

Before we can flash our application onto a dev board from uVision we must first flash [our bootloader](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openblt/). OpenBLT-based bootloaders were required for development starting with the 0.3.0 release of our firmware.

### Bootloader

Flashing a dev board with a bootloader `.hex` file only needs to be done once. uVision should not overwrite the bootloader when we flash our application. The bootloader contents starts at the beginning of ROM (as definied by the micro) so if that gets erased by accident then we must reprogram it.
To prevent overwriting the bootloader when using Keil, the J-Link Flash Download Settings may be set to erase sectors (rather than full chip) and the address space can be adjusted for each device:
* XMC1400 Boot Kit - Flash Start: 0x10003000, Flash Size: 0x00030000 (8KB Reserved)
* XMC4400 Platform2Go - Flash Start: 0x0C00C000, Flash Size: 0x00074000, Cached Flash Start: 0x0800C000, Cached Flash Size: 0x00074000 (48KB Reserved)
* XMC4800 AWS - Flash Start: 0x0C00C000, Flash Size: 0x00100000, Cached Flash Start: 0x000F4000, Cached Flash Size: 0x000F4000  (48KB Reserved)

The most recent `.hex` bootloader file for the XMC4400 Platform2Go can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dYsagXs5T2jxb9FgIlXM-XnMNAjgvivO) on Google Drive.

The most recent `.hex` bootloader file for the XMC4800 IoT AWS can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1OAlV2jzjQ4OmFRCrWmOMO4gPtQkUs26M) on Google Drive.

To flash an XMC4400 Platform2Go dev board with our bootloader:

1. Connect a micro USB cable to your Windows machine
2. Plug the micro USB end of the cable into the dev board
3. Launch J-Flash Lite
4. Select **XMC4400-512** from the **Device** menu
5. Select **SWD** and **4000 kHz** from the **Interface** menus
6. Click on the **OK** button
7. Click on the **Erase Chip** button
8. Click on the **...** button
9. Locate the XMC4400 Platform2Go bootloader `.hex` file
10. Click on the **Open** button
11. Click on the **Program Device** button
12. Close J-Flash Lite

To boot an XMC4400 Platform2Go dev board into bootloader mode:

1. Plug the micro USB end of the cable into the dev board
2. Hold down the leftmost button for 1 second
3. Press the rightmost button
4. Release both buttons

The red LED next to the leftmost button should blink rapidly.

### Application

To flash a dev board after building the project for that target from uVision:

1. Connect a micro USB cable to your Windows machine
2. Plug the micro USB end of the cable into the dev board
3. Click on the **Download** button on the toolbar to flash the dev board
4. Hit the reset button on the dev board to begin executing the newly flashed code

**Note**: Continue reading if flashing fails with **Cannot load device description!**

The `.flm` files for the device packs install to your user directory not `C:/Keil_v5/ARM/Flash`. The subdirectory containing the missing XMC4000 series `.flm` files is `AppData\Local\Arm\Packs\Infineon\XMC4000_DFP\2.13.0\Flash`. Copy the contents of that directory into `C:/Keil_v5/ARM/Flash` and flashing an XMC4400 Platform2Go should succeed.

To update an XMC4400 Platform2Go dev board while in bootloader mode:

1. Connect a micro USB cable to your Windows machine
2. Boot an XMC4400 Platform2Go dev board into bootloader mode
3. Launch MicroBoot
4. Click on the **Settings** button
5. Select **XCP on RS232** for the **Commmunication Interface**
6. Select the COM port for the micro USB **Device**
7. Select **57600** for the **Baudrate**
8. Click on the **OK** button
9. Click on the **Browse** button
10. Locate the XMC4400 Platform2Go `.srec` file
11. Click on the **Open** button

MicroBoot should reprogram the application section of the flash and exit. The bootloader will then hand off execution to the application causing the red LED to blink more slowly (2 Hz).

## Debugging

Ed Hatfield has created a SerialCom tool for communicating with devices over UART. The tool is a .NET desktop application so it requires Windows to run.

A Zip archive of the SerialCom application and DLLs can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hGxYy2s3axgjWrBKq_vd7IuC12rK6jHC) on Google Drive. Download and extract the Zip archive to your Windows machine.

The Personality XML file can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wa868_I3dZEuS4hb66f0QnIQh5uuFFH0) on Google Drive. Download the Personality XML file to your Windows machine.

To use the SerialCom tool:

1. Launch the SerialCom application
2. Click on the **Open Personality** (folder) button
3. Locate the Personality XML file for the latest firmware release
4. Click on the **Port Settings** (gears) button
5. Set the COM port and baud rate to 115200 for the built-in debugger
6. Click the **Build and Send** button or double-click commands on the left tree view

The tool saves your settings when exiting for next time.
